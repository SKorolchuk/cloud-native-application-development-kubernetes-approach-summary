# Kubernetes goals and usage advantages

| Kubernetes project goal |
| ------- |
| The Kubernetes project community and contributing companies aim to create universal container orchestration and management system that suits for applications of any scale and facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.  |

| Why do I need Kubernetes? |
| ----- |
|
    Manage applications, not machines
        - Kubernetes creates abstraction layer between network, storage, security and computational infrastructure to concentrate on fast application development, deployment and delivery
|
Portable and universal container management environment
•	Literally, it’s next generation distributed OS for Cloud world
Easy to create and deliver microservice-based applications
•	Kubernetes has all necessary resource abstractions and extensibility points to fit with well-done microservice architecture from day-one.
The simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) with the flexibility of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
•	All external cluster administration is managed from kubectl tool under secure tunnel with resources that have good separation of concerns between interface definition and control implementation.
Flexible workflow abstractions
•	Kubernetes doesn’t dictate what you should use for your application infrastructure, but helps with proper choice and integration.
