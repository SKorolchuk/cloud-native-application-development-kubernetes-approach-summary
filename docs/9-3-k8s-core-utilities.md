| <b><i>kubectl</i></b>    | Kubectl is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. While Kubectl has many different commands, they fall into only a few categories:<ul><li><b><i>Declaratively Creating, Updating, Deleting Resources (Apply)</i></b></li><li><b><i>Debugging Workloads and Reading Cluster State</i></b></li><li><b><i>Managing the cluster itself</i></b></li><li><b><i>Porcelain commands for working with Resources</i></b></li></ul> Users may find using Resource Config overly verbose for Development and prefer to work with the cluster <i>imperatively</i> with a shell-like workflow. Kubectl offers porcelain commands for generating and modifying Resources.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| <b><i>kubeadm</i></b>    | kubeadm is a tool built to provide set of utilities as best-practice “fast paths” for creating Kubernetes clusters. kubeadm performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running. By design, it cares <b>only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines.</b>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| <b><i>kubelet</i></b>    | Kubelet is the component responsible for everything running on a worker node. Its initial job is to register the node it’s running on by creating a Node resource in the API server. Then it needs to  continuously monitor the API server for Pods that have been scheduled to the node, and start the pod’s containers. It does this by telling the configured container runtime (which is Docker, CoreOS rkt, or something else) to run a container from a specific container image. Kubelet then constantly monitors running containers and reports their status, events, and resource consumption to the API server. The Kubelet is also the component that runs the container liveness probes, restarting containers when the probes fail. Lastly, it terminates containers when their Pod is deleted from the API server and notifies the server that the pod has terminated. |
| <b><i>kubefed</i></b>    | kubefed controls a Kubernetes Cluster Federation initialization and management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <b><i>kube-proxy</i></b> | Everything related to Service resources is handled by the kube-proxy process running on each node. kube-proxy was an actual proxy waiting for connections and for each incoming connection, opening a new connection to one of the pods. This was called the userspace proxy mode. Later, a better-performing iptables proxy mode replaced it. This is now the default, but you can still configure Kubernetes to use the old mode if you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
